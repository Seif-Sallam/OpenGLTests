# OpenGL-Tests

This is a project created mainly to create test benches for differnet Opengl features. The differnet tests are added one by one each serving the purpose of creating small, clean, and consice code to show the feature and how to write its code easily for future reference.

## Compiling the project 

This project was developed on Linux Ubuntu 20.0. It also contains a Makefile that you can run to compile the whole project and will generate the binary file _opengl_.

## Available tests:

* Clear Color
